# Implementation Plan: Speed Reader Web Application

**Branch**: `001-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: /Users/kien.ha/Code/speed-reader/specs/001-i-want-to/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Build a responsive web application that helps users increase reading speed and comprehension in English and Vietnamese. Provide three reading modes (word-by-word, chunk-of-meaning, paragraph with highlights), allow custom text input or AI-generated content, generate comprehension questions after reading, and track analytics (time, words, WPM, scores). Implement with Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui, and Gemini AI API. Local-first developer workflow via docker-compose.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript, Next.js (App Router)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, shadcn/ui, Drizzle ORM, Gemini AI API, Zod (validation)  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL  
**Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Vitest (unit/integration)  
**Target Platform**: Web (desktop + mobile responsive)
**Project Type**: web  
**Performance Goals**: Smooth animations at 60fps; session metrics computed in <50ms; initial page TTI <2.5s  
**Constraints**: Local-first via docker-compose; avoid premature abstractions; Modular Design, DRY, SRP  
**Scale/Scope**: Initial single-node deployment; low concurrency; <10k MAU

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Simplicity**:

- Projects: 1 (single Next.js app with API routes)
- Using framework directly: Yes (no wrapper classes)
- Single data model: Yes (Drizzle models map to DB; no extra DTOs)
- Avoiding patterns: Yes (no Repository/UoW without need)

**Architecture**:

- Feature modules: UI components + service functions per domain (content, sessions, quiz, analytics)
- Libraries: shadcn/ui (UI), Drizzle (ORM), Gemini (AI generation)
- CLI per library: N/A (web app); use framework CLIs for setup only
- Documentation: Quickstart + contracts present

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:

- RED-GREEN-Refactor enforced (write failing tests first)
- Order: Contract → Integration → E2E → Unit
- Real dependencies: Yes (dockerized PostgreSQL)
- Integration tests: Contracts and DB interactions
- FORBIDDEN: Skipping RED phase

**Observability**:

- Structured logging with context in server actions and API routes
- Frontend errors surfaced with user context; no PII
- Clear, actionable error messages

**Versioning**:

- Semantic versioning planned post-MVP; DB migrations via Drizzle
- Breaking changes require migration plan

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project: Next.js app with API routes)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, quickstart.md, GEMINI.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |

## Progress Tracking
