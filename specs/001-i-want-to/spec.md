# Feature Specification: Speed Reader Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to create a speed reader web application. This app helps users increase their reading speed and understanding ability. Supporting English and Vietnamese at the early. There are 3 reading modes: read word by word, read a chunk of meaning works and read a paragraph with highlight word/chunk of meaning words. Users can upload their paragraph, essay,... or generate from AI features. After reading, AI creates some questions base on the content to test the understanding ability of users. This app has a logs system to track and analyze the study process of users, calculate the reading time/words. Must be responsive on both web/moble correctly"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story

As a learner, I want to practice speed reading in English or Vietnamese using three guided modes (word-by-word, chunk-of-meaning, and paragraph with highlights) so that I can increase my reading speed and comprehension.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I select English or Vietnamese and paste my own text, **When** I start "word-by-word" mode with adjustable speed, **Then** the app presents one word at a time, allows pause/resume, and logs total time, words read, and calculated WPM.
2. **Given** I choose "chunk-of-meaning" mode, **When** I start reading, **Then** the app presents grouped phrases/chunks sequentially, allows controlling chunk size and speed, and logs time and WPM-equivalent metrics.
3. **Given** I choose "paragraph with highlights" mode, **When** I read, **Then** the app displays the full paragraph and dynamically highlights the current word/chunk as I progress, with controls for pace and navigation, and logs session metrics.
4. **Given** I don't have my own text, **When** I request AI to generate content by topic, language, and length, **Then** appropriate content is generated and used immediately in any reading mode.
5. **Given** I finish a reading session, **When** I tap "Assess comprehension", **Then** the app generates a short quiz about the text, I answer, and I receive a score with feedback.
6. **Given** I complete multiple sessions over time, **When** I open my study analytics, **Then** I can see cumulative time spent, average WPM per mode, and comprehension trends.
7. **Given** I open the app on a phone, **When** I use any reading mode, **Then** the experience is responsive and usable on mobile (controls reachable, text readable, no horizontal scrolling).

### Edge Cases

- Very long text inputs: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum characters/words allowed per session]
- Non-English/Vietnamese text: display a clear message that early release supports only English and Vietnamese
- Inappropriate or unsafe content in uploads/AI output: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: content policy and filtering standards]
- AI generation failure or timeout: provide a clear error and allow retry or manual text input
- Upload formats beyond plain text: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: accepted formats (e.g., .txt, .docx, .pdf) or paste-only]
- Accessibility: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: keyboard navigation, color contrast, and screen reader expectations]
- Network loss during session or quiz: warn the user and preserve progress locally until connectivity resumes
- Rate limits for AI generation: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: per-user/day limits]

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST support English and Vietnamese content at launch and allow users to choose language per session.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide three reading modes: word-by-word, chunk-of-meaning, and paragraph with dynamic highlights.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow users to input custom text via paste and/or file upload. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: confirm upload vs paste-only]
- **FR-004**: The system MUST offer AI-generated content by topic/prompt with selectable language and approximate length. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target length units]
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide controls to start, pause, resume, and stop any reading session.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow adjusting pace (e.g., words per minute) for all modes. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: default pace, min/max bounds]
- **FR-007**: The system MUST allow adjusting chunk size for chunk-of-meaning mode. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: automatic vs manual chunking]
- **FR-008**: The system MUST, after a session ends, generate comprehension questions based on the session content and present a short quiz. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question types and count]
- **FR-009**: The system MUST compute and display session metrics: total time, total words, and reading speed (WPM or equivalent) per mode.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST store session logs for later analysis, including session settings (mode, pace, chunk size), metrics, and quiz score.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST provide a study analytics view summarizing historical metrics (time spent, average speed, comprehension score trends).
- **FR-012**: The system MUST be responsive and usable on common mobile and desktop breakpoints.
- **FR-013**: The system MUST provide localized UI labels and messages in English and Vietnamese and allow switching language. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: per-session vs global setting]
- **FR-014**: The system MUST present clear, actionable error messages for failures (AI generation, uploads, network) and allow retry.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST handle basic accessibility expectations (keyboard controls for playback, readable contrast, scalable text). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: target accessibility standard]
- **FR-016**: The system MUST enforce reasonable limits and rate limits on AI generation to ensure availability. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: limits]
- **FR-017**: The system MUST protect user data and clarify retention. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: signed-in accounts vs anonymous sessions and data retention period]

### Key Entities (include if feature involves data)

- **User**: Represents a learner. May be authenticated or anonymous. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication in scope for this feature?]
- **ReadingContent**: The text to read; attributes include language, source (upload/paste vs AI-generated), title/topic (if any), and length (characters/words).
- **ReadingSession**: A single reading exercise instance; attributes include content reference, mode, pace (WPM), chunk size (if applicable), start/end timestamps, duration, words read, and computed speed.
